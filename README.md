Organizer
=========

The organizer will help you sort your media files in folders easily
and conveniently.

With this program installed on your home computer, all you need to do is
simply start your file manager, select the files to organize with a right
click, then select Organize media files from the Open with... menu.  You
can also run the program `organizer` from the command line, specifying
the paths to the files you want to organize as arguments to the program.

Optionally, if the program `takeown` is installed, the organizer will
automatically attempt to take ownership of the files prior to organizing
them.  This saves you an extra work step.
